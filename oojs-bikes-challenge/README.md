# Objectives

For this challenge, your task is to implement JavaScript code that will make the provided driver code run without errors or output. **You should NOT need to change the driver code to make things work.**

**Be sure to use the comments at the top of the `station.js` file and the driver code to help guide you when deciding what types of objects to create. **

# Useful Notes / Tidbits

- For a successful solution, you'll need both "object literals" and objects created with a "constructor" and "prototype".
- You can work in Sublime Text 2, then cut-and-paste your code into the Chrome JavaScript console for testing. If `node` is installed, you can run your JS source file from the terminal by typing `node station.js`.
